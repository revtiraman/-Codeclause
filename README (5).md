# Introduction
## Why is employee attrition an issue?
- High turnover rates / employee attrition are becoming a huge issue for organisations
- The Great Attrition --> [Click here for more information about The Great Attrition](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools)
- High cost of hiring + training + time-taken for recruitment & onboarding

## What is the problem statement of the project?
- Challenges for organisations to retain their current workforce
- Lack of reliable machine learning tools to predict employee attrition

## Aims & Objectives (What do I aim to achive?) üåü
**The Aims**
- The overall aim of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that would play a vital part in HRM by accurately predicting employee attrition

**The Objectives**
- To obtain employee attrition dataset with more observations as compared with previous work
- To identify the key features that could affect prediction of employee attrition
- To build a model (and evaluate model performance) that could accurately predict employee attrition

# Data Preparation
- Dataset exploration üîç
- Data selection & cleaning üßπ
  - Removing irrelavant features
  - Convert data structure to the suitable ones (*cases where categorical variables are loaded as character instead of factor in RStudio*)
  - Missing values & imputation (*Let's replace the missing values!*)
  - Feature selection (*Does some variables really significantly contribute to the prediction of employee attrition?*)
  - Class distribution of the target variable (*It seems there might be a huge class imbalance issue*) --> Data Re-sampling needed!

  - Click here to know more about oversampling --> [What is oversampling or undersampling in machine learning?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üßÆ
  - Univariate analysis
  - Bivariate analysis
- One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding üñ•Ô∏è

# Model Implementation
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Naive Bayes (NB)

# Performance Evaluation

- DT performed the best as compared with other models experimented
- Model perofmrance for DT is consistent
- The dataset used was the oversampling dataset without the issue of class imbalance

# Recommendations for Future Work
- Dataset with more observations 
- Build predictive model with real HR dataset (*Current dataset is a fictional dataset provided by IBM*)
- Include more variables (*Such as work from home, hybrid or full physical*) 
- Different feature selection algorithm (*Boruta algorithm was used in this project*)
